Avoiding the [Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pttqFUviWs) in a marathon requires careful pacing over the first half of the race. Given the length of the race and the time it takes to recover, most runners only attempt a marathon race a 1-2 times a year, making it difficult to accurately predict their target pace. The most widely-used [methods for predicting performance](http://run-down.com/statistics/calcs_explained.php) are all pretty [old](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~phoffman/xcinfo3.html) and make questionable assumptions. 

As a runner and statistician, I think I can do better. This page will outline my methods to make a better marathon performance predictor.
